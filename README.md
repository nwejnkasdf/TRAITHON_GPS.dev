### 5.1. Summary: 
Working as Data Scientist, performed statistical bias and robustness analysis for a clickbait detection system, including dependency tests, stress testing, and fairness monitoring design.

### 5.2. Detail:
- Defined and analyzed data bias issues in a clickbait article detection AI competition, statistically validating whether section-wise performance gaps stem from genuine section effects or structural confounding.
- Applied χ² tests and CMH conditional independence tests to disentangle section effects from processing-pattern confounders, and developed an effect-size – driven interpretation framework.
- Designed and conducted a section-swapping stress test to evaluate the impact of section–label dependency on model performance, confirming robustness to structural bias within the current data scope.
- Extended data and model analysis into an SLI/SLO-based fairness monitoring and risk management framework, proposing exposure-aware section-wise bias detection metrics and operational thresholds.
